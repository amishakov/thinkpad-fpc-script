# thinkpad-fpc-script

FPC Fingerprint reader driver installer for Thinkpad E14/E15 Gen 4.

After installation, you will be able to enroll fingerprints in the GNOME settings (Settings -> Users).

By default, GNOME enables fingerprint login in gdm, although this method will not unlock the keyring since it is password encrypted
